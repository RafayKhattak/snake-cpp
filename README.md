# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake Game implementation in C++ using the Raylib library. The game allows the player to control a snake and navigate it on a grid to eat food and grow longer. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Features

- Score tracking: Keep track of the current score and the highest score achieved.
- Sound effects: Enjoy audio feedback with sound effects for eating food, hitting the wall, and moving the snake.
- High score persistence: The highest score is saved to a file and loaded when the game is launched.
